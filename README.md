# Wreath

## Introduction

Wreath is a toolchain for the Twine hypertext system, suitable for command-line usage or for inclusion into graphical user interfaces. It is capable of full introspection upon abstract syntax on the six primary Twine syntaxes (Gately, Harlowe, Snowman, Sugar(cane|cube), TiddlyWiki, and Twee), as well as Github-Flavored Markdown, Javascript, and CSS. Intended functions include compilation, transpilation, simpler and more manageable inclusion of external code resources, linting, randomwalk testing, and more. Further documentation will follow in this space soon. Wreath is not ready for public usage at this time, and attempts to use it for Twine stories in progress will waste time and produce no value.

## Installation

If you don't already have Node.js installed, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once Node is installed, use a terminal of your choice to navigate to the specific, story-specific folder in which your Twine story has been published, and enter:

`npm install --save wreath`

## Usage

In your story folder, enter `wreath`, and some options which haven't been standardized yet.
